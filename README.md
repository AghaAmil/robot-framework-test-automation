# Robot Framework Test Automation Course
This repository contains my learning and projects from the Robot Framework test automation course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/robot-framework-level-1/).

# Course Overview
The course teaches the fundamentals of test automation using the Robot Framework, a keyword-driven test automation framework for acceptence testing and regression testing. Some of the key things covered in the course include:

- Install & configure the Robot Framework test automation tool plus libraries like Selenium, API, database, and more
- Create & run your first Robot Framework test automation script (Selenium Webdriver example)
- Understand the basics of many Robot Framework test automation libraries (Selenium Webdriver, API, Database, XML, Files, etc.)
- Use the page object pattern to create more reusable, easier to interpret test automation scripts
- Run/execute Robot Framework automated tests in many different ways, including from a command window, batch files, Jenkins, and Windows task scheduler
- Create user defined keywords to express your tests in business domain terms instead of cryptic Selenium Webdriver code

Throughout the course, I will update readme.md for further informaiton
